# The Daily Planets | A way to keep your perspective expanded.

## Description

> Lately the news can seem pretty bleak.  A look at the days headlines can make Earth's gravity feel even heavier.  Sometimes a little perspective can help make the medicine go down.  Enjoy a selection of photos from the Mars Curiosity rover along with your news.

## Usage

> Pick a date from 2021 to the present, and you will be presented with a Top new story from that date, as well as a small sampling of photos from the mars curiosity rover.  (Note, not all dates have photos available, with more refinement, we could only include dates that have rover photos.)
